# About this project
This is the Government of Alberta - Nx plugin for dotnet.

The plugin includes generators for setting up dotnet workspace configuration, and executors for `dotnet` cli commands.

**Deprecated** - Use [nx-dotnet/core](https://github.com/nx-dotnet/nx-dotnet) for dotnet generators and executors.
